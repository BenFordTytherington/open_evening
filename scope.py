# Topics: Scope #

# THE CHALLENGE - create 10 variables: 
# the first 5 in any local scope, the last 5 in global scope of the following data types and names
# all names specified are required for the checker as well as the function func
# Boolean         LOCAL    b
# Integer         LOCAL    i
# Float           LOCAL    f
# Any Sequence    LOCAL    seq
# Any Binary      LOCAL    by
# Map             GLOBAL   m
# String          GLOBAL   st
# Set             GLOBAL   s
# Generator       GLOBAL   g
# Null            GLOBAL   n
