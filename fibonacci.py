# Topics: Sequences #

# The function fib is required to have that name for the challenge checker !! DO NOT CHANGE !!


# BACKGROUND:
# The fibonacci sequence is a very well known sequence in maths famous for its appearance in nature in sprial patterns
# The golden ration is also obtained by dividing elements of the fibonacci sequence
# It is formed by taking 2 elements and finding the third by summing the 2 before it
# 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

# THE CHALLENGE - Create a function which returns the first n fibonacci numbers with an initial condition

# TIPS:
# Can be done in a variety of ways but many different methods can be optimised
# common optimizations include recursion (callign a function inside its definition), 
# lookup tables (dictionaries), 
# caching (functools.cache decorator) 
# and generators
