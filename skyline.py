# Topics: 2D arrays #

# The variables skyline and avg_height are required to have that name for the challenge checker !! DO NOT CHANGE !!

# represent a skyline with the 1s being buildings and 0s being sky (MUST be a 2D array with ROWS representing heights as shown below)
skyline: list = []

# example skyline to matrix / 2D array operation

#     1 1   1               [0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0]
#   1 1 1   1 1    becomes  [0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0]

# THE CHALLENGE - Compute the average height of buildings in your chosen skyline and store it in the avg_height variable
